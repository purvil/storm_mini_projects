# Storm Mini Projects

### [Hello World](https://github.com/purvil/storm_mini_projects/tree/master/helloWorld)
* It is a very basic project with one spout and one bolt. 
* Spout will generate incremental integer numbers and pass to connected Bolt. Bolt will multiply this number by 2, to make it even.

### [Read From File](https://github.com/purvil/storm_mini_projects/tree/master/readingFile)
* Spout will read data from file line by line
* Bolt will process each line and modify it.
